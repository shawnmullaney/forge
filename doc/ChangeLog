LEGEND
[bug] general bug fix.  This is generally a backward compatible change,
        unless it's deemed to be impossible or very hard to keep
        compatibility to fix the bug.
[build] compilation and installation infrastructure change.
[doc] update to documentation. This shouldn't change run time behavior.
[func] new feature.  In some cases this may be a backward incompatible
        change, which would require a bump of major version.
[security] security hole fix. This is no different than a general bug
        fix except that it will be handled as confidential and will cause
        security patch releases.
*: Backward incompatible or operational change.
