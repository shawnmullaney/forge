ISC Forge
=========

ISC Forge is an open source DHCP conformance validation framework. It is a
joint project done by Internet Systems Consortium, a non profit company based
in Redwood City, California and students from Gdansk Univesity of Technology.

The goal of this project is to develop open source validation framework that
will be able to validate DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 implementations. Its primary focus
is on RFC compliance, but other validation aspects will be covered as well.

The framework is written in Python and uses the following libraries:
- Scapy (for packet generation/parsing)
- Lettuce (for test definitions/management)
- Fabric (for remote server configuration)

Participants
============
- Włodzimierz Wencel (Gdansk University, DHCPv6 validation)
- Maciek Fijałkowski (Gdansk University, DHCPv6 validation)
- Tomek Mrugalski (ISC, technical consultant)
- Marcin Siodelski (ISC, technical consultant)
- Stephen Morris (ISC, engineering manager)

Former participants
